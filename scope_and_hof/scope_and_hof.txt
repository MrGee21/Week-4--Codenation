Activity (1)
Write a simple function which logs “Hello Code 
Nation” to the console.
Then write a higher order function which will run 
our simple function five times, even though you 
only call it one time.
Hint: Pass the simple function as a parameter, and 
this will involve a for loop.


Activity (2)
The array method .map is an example of a higher 
order function.
Declare a variable with five numbers, then 
use .map to iterate through the array and multiply 
each array item by 3.
